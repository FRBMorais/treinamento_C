/*
1. Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns the MSB (most
significant bit) as a new integer. For example, extract_msb(10) should return 1
(binary: 1010).


2. Create a function that takes an integer (4 bits) as an argument and returns the LSB
(least significant bit) as a new integer. For example, extract_lsb(10) should return 0
(binary: 1010).


3. Write a function that takes an integer and a value n as arguments and returns a new
integer with the n most significant bits isolated. For example, isolate_msb(10,2)
should return 2 (binary: 10).

4. Create a function that takes an integer (4 bits) and a value n as arguments and returns
a new integer with the n least significant bits isolated. For example,
isolate_lsb(10,2) should return 2 (binary: 10).

7. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer (4 bits) and returns the number with
all bits inverted. For example, invert_bits(5) should return 10 (binary: 1010).

8. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer (8 bits) and returns the most
significant nibble (the 4 leftmost bits) as a new integer. For example,
isolate_nibble_ms(240) should return 15 (binary: 1111).
A nibble represents half of a byte, i.e. a nibble is composed of 4 consecutive bits.


9. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer (8 bits) and returns the least
significant nibble (the rightmost 4 bits) as a new integer. For example,
isolate_nibble_ls(240) should return 0 (binary: 0000).

11. Use bitwise operators to check if an integer is a power of 2.

17. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns the number of 1 bits in
its binary representation. For example, count_bits_1(5) should return 2 (binary: 101).

18. Use bitwise operators to check whether an integer is even or odd.

22. Create a function that takes a 2â€™s complement integer (4 bits) as an argument and
returns its equivalent decimal representation. For example,
convert_decimal(0b1011) should return 5 (decimal).

34. Write a function that uses the left bit shift operator (<<) to double an integer.

35. Create a function that uses the right bit shift operator (>>) to divide an integer by 2.
