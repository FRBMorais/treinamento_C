Implement a linked list of integers, as presented during this lecture. The input consists of
several cases. The first line contains c: the number of cases. The first line of each case
contains n: the number of operations to be performed on the list. At the beginning of each
case, the list must be empty. The next n lines consist of commands of the following types:
insert x, remove, prev, next, and count. Besides printing the case number, for
each command count x, print the number of
occurrences of x in the list.
