/*
Implement a queue of integers, as presented during this lecture. The input consists of
several cases. The first line contains c: the number of cases. Each case consists of two
types of commands: enqueue x and dequeue n, the latter removes the first n numbers
and computes their sum. A line with end signals the end of the case. Besides printing the
case number, for each command dequeue n,
print the sum of the first n elements in the list.


Sample input
1
enqueue 10
enqueue 20
enqueue 5
dequeue 2
enqueue 1
enqueue 16
enqueue 12
enqueue 15
deqeue 5
end

Sample Output
Caso 1:
30
49
