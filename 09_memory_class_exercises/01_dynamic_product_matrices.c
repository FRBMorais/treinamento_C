/* QUESTION

Write a program that takes two matrices from the standard input (with an arbitrary number
of lines and columns), and computes the matrix product. If the matrices cannot be
multiplied (i.e., the number of columns of the first matrix is different from the number of
rows of the second matrix), print an error message, and terminate the program.
