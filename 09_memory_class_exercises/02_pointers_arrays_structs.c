/* QUESTION

Write a program that reads from the standard input a number of entries of type
person_t. Ask the user the number of entries and, for each one, the number of
characters of the associated name (modify the previous definition of person_t
accordingly). Store the data in an array of pointers to person_t (i.e., person_t**).
Finally, print all data in the standard output.
